            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate web developement learner with no experience in creating dynamic websites. My expertise are neither in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, nor in front-end frameworks like React and Vue.js. I only think to create beautiful and user-friendly web experiences because firstly i don't have that much patience and next thing or main reason is that this is not the area for me to rock as I am a medical student and I am learning this only to look cool.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thank You for loving my honesty and also I am grateful to you for having a few minutes of your produvtive time reading this non-productive portfolio and very sorry at the same time.</p>
            <br>          
            <p>Feel free to suggest your dopamine desensitized friend this webite and go through the resource that I have provided. You also can have some sort of productive information after going throough all this not much meaningless Texts. But trust me after going through all of the provided information you might feel worth it.</p>
