We often Expect much but didn't even get 1% of what we had expected and the same goes here. Here is an beautiful shlok from Bhagavad Gita "You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction"
